## 🚀 Features & Highlights

### 🔹 Business Problem
Indian general elections are massive in scale and complexity. Citizens, journalists, and political experts often struggle to extract key patterns from raw, tabular data. Key questions like:

- Who won the majority?
- Which state had the biggest shift?
- How did independent candidates perform?
- What was the winning margin in key constituencies?

... are hard to answer quickly without visual analytics.

---

### 🔹 Goal of the Dashboard
To build an accessible and dynamic dashboard that:
- Delivers **nationwide and localized political insights**.
- Supports **constituency-level drill-down**.
- Assists in **party performance benchmarking**.
- Allows users to **compare alliances (NDA, I.N.D.I.A., Others)** across states and demographics.
